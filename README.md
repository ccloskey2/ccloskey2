# 👋 Hi, I'm Catherine!

## 🚀 Student Studying Neuroscience and Behavior, Computing and Digital Technologies, and Data Science

📍 **United States**  


## Introduction 🌐
My name is Catherine Closkey. I am a student in my third year at the University of Notre Dame. 

**Academic Curriculum**: I am currently majoring in Neuroscience and Behavior in the College of Science, where I will graduate with a Bachelor of Science in May 2026. I have minors in Data Science and Computing and Digital Technologies with a concentration on the Cybersafety and Security track. 

**Some of My Favorite Activities**: Outside of my academic curriculum, I love to ski, sail, surf, take long walks on the beach with my dog, and bake!

### Education 🎓
- **University of Notre Dame**, Bachelor of Science, Neuroscience and Behavior (2026)

## Current Projects ⚙️
- **Introduction to Data Science**
    - [*Data Science Portfolio*](https://github.com/ccloskey2/CLOSKEY-Data-Science-Portolio)
          - This portfolio consists of the projects I will be working on this semester in Introduction to Data Science. These projects include using Python libraries such as Pandas,                Seaborn, Plotly, and Streamlit for data manipulation, visualization, and application development. Projects expand to applications of machine learning concepts such as model             selection, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation to real-world data. Advanced projects include applications of large language models and                      neural networks for analytics and decision-making.  

## Skills 🛠️
   - Python: Pandas, Seaborn, Beautiful Soup, Plotly, Matplot lib (***basic level***)
   - Magnet AXIOM Forensic Software - ***Magnet Certified Forensic Examiner (2023)***
   - GrayKey Software
   - **Introduction to Data Science** (Spring, 2025)
        - Data science skills: Python libraries of Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, Streamlit
        - Machine learning techniques: large language models, neural networks
        - Ethical practices

## Goals 🚀 
- This year, I am expanding my interests into the Data Science field  as I have learned through my computing coursework that data science is fascinating. Through my combined interests in the biology of the brain and study of human behavior, I want to apply these interests to the computing and data science world by analzying trends in health, society, and politics in order to predict trends, solve complex problems, and make impactful solutions. Specifically, I would like to develop my technical skills with regard to making interactive visualizations through Python data science libraries such as Streamlit that users can engage with. I would also like to use neural networks and large language models in order to create fascinating algorithms and predict trends.

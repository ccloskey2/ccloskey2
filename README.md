# ðŸŒº Hello, I'm Catherine!

## â˜¾ About Me
My name is Catherine Closkey. I am currently a student in my third year at the University of Notre Dame. 

### Education:
- **University of Notre Dame**, Bachelor of Science, *Neuroscience and Behavior* (2026)
  - In addition to majoring in Neuroscience and Behavior, I also have minors in *Data Science* and *Computing and Digital Technologies* with a concentration on         the Cybersafety and Security track.
  - This year, I am expanding my interests into the Data Science field  as I have learned through my computing coursework that data science is fascinating. Through     my combined interests in the biology of the brain and study of human behavior, I want to apply these interests to the computing and data science world by           analzying trends in health, society, and politics in order to predict trends, solve complex problems, and make impactful solutions. 

### Professional Highlights:
- **Digital Forensic Investigator**: St. Joseph County Cyber Crimes Unit, Notre Dame, Indiana (2024 - Present)

## Current Projects
- **Introduction to Data Science**
    - [Data Science Portfolio](https://github.com/ccloskey2/CLOSKEY-Data-Science-Portolio)
      - This portfolio consists of the projects I will be working on this semester in Introduction to Data Science. These projects include:
        -  Using Python libraries such as Pandas Seaborn, Plotly, and Streamlit for data manipulation, visualization, and application development. 
        -  Applications of machine learning concepts such as model selection, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation to real-world data. 
        -  Advanced projects including applications of large language models and neural networks for analytics and decision-making. 

## Skills
   - **Python**: Pandas, Seaborn, Beautiful Soup, Plotly, Matplot lib (*basic level*)
   - **Magnet AXIOM Forensic Software**: *Magnet Certified Forensic Examiner (2023)*
   - **GrayKey Software**

## Goals
- By the end of this semester, my goals are to:
  - Develop my technical skills with regard to making interactive visualizations through Python data science libraries such as Streamlit that users can engage with.
  - In conjunction with creating visualizations, I would like to develop skills in "data storytelling" that will enable me to present my findings and inspire          productive change in my audience.
  - With regard to predictive modeling, I would also like to use neural networks and large language models in order to create fascinating algorithms and predict        trends.
